# 🎬 MovieRec-Transformer
🚀 Transformer-based **Movie Recommendation System** built from scratch – no pre-trained models, fully custom.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **transformer-based recommendation system** for movies using **deep learning and self-attention mechanisms**. Unlike traditional collaborative filtering (e.g., IMDb), this approach learns contextual and sequential patterns in user preferences.

## 🔥 Features
- **Built from scratch** – No pre-trained models.
- **Self-Attention for Recommendations** – Leverages **transformers** to model user preferences.
- **Hybrid Filtering** – Mix of content-based & collaborative filtering.
- **Scalable Deployment** – API-based serving & CoreML export.

## 🚀 Quick Start
### 1️⃣ Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/MovieRec-Transformer.git
